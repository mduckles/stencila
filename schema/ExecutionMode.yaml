    '@id': stencila:Always
    description: |
      Always execute the node when the document or ancestor node is executed.
      Use this for nodes that you want to always be executed, even if they, or
      their upstream dependencies, are not stale.
  - const: Auto
    '@id': stencila:Auto
    description: |
      Automatically execute the node if it is stale and is an upstream dependency of a node
      that is to be executed, or is a downstream dependant of a node that has been executed.
  - const: Needed

    description: |
      Execute the node when needed (i.e. if it is stale) when the document or ancestor
      node is executed.
  - const: Safe
    '@id': stencila:Safe
    description: |
      Execute the node if is considered safe to do so (e.g. no detected filesystem access),
      or can be executed in a sandbox, otherwise generate a warning.
  - const: Secure
    '@id': stencila:Secure
    description: |
      Execute the node in a secure sandbox and generate a warning if that is not possible.
  - const: Locked

    description: |
      Do not execute the node. Requires that the node is unlocked first to be executed.

    description: |
      Never execute the node. Same a `Locked` but used for `executionRecursion` property.
